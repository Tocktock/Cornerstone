# Project Overview
- Purpose: Embedding-based search/Q&A prototype that can switch between OpenAI and local HuggingFace embedding models, store vectors in Qdrant, and expose a FastAPI + Jinja2 UI.
- Current state: Repository only contains planning documentation (`docs/practical-implementation-plan.md`). No source code or configuration implemented yet.
